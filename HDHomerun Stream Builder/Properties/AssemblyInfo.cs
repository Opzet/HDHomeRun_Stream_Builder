[assembly: AssemblyDescription("I wrote this quick utility after a bit of frustration getting my HDHomerun Prime to play in XBMC. The Perl scripts I found would work for some channels but not others and the experience setting it up seemed just too complex, so here ya go. This utility will help in discovering the channels from your HDHR, caching them, then allow you to select your favorites for use in the TV Guide addon or just to create the strm files if you want.")]
